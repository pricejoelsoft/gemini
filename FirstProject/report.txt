Project Phoenix - Q3 Technical Report

The primary finding for this quarter is the successful integration of the Python-based monitoring agent into the legacy C++ system, resulting in a 35% reduction in latency for data retrieval. This was achieved in Sprint 7.

The two main risks remain: 1) Supply chain disruption for the custom memory chips. 2) The ongoing developer turnover impacting the C++ knowledge base.

Recommendation: Immediately prioritize cross-training the new Python team members on the C++ modules to mitigate risk 2.
